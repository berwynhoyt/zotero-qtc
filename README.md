# zotero-qtc
Zotero style to match Queensland Theological College requirements.
Works just like the standard Zotero SBL style, but with enhancements.

Usage:
* When you wish a citation footnote to be formatted for ancient documents like the church fathers, Calvin, etc., add "ancient:true" to the "Extra" Zotero field for that book.

Easy to install:
* Download the [SBL-QTC style in raw format here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/berwynhoyt/zotero-qtc/main/society-of-biblical-literature-fullnote-bibliography-qtc.csl).
* In Zotero go to the usual place to install styles which is edit/preferences/cite/styles
* Click on the grey '+' button on the right-hand side. Browse to the place where you downloaded the style file and select it. It is now installed.
* As usual, go to Word, click the Zotero / Document Preferences and select the new citation style called "Society of Biblical Literature 2nd edition (full note) - QTC"
* Click 'OK' and the 'Refresh' button in the Zotero menu. It should be working
