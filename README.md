# zotero-qtc
Zotero style to match Queensland Theological College requirements.
Works just like the standard Zotero SBL style, but with enhancements.

Usage:
* When you wish a citation footnote to be formatted for ancient documents like the church fathers, Calvin, etc., add "ancient:true" to the "Extra" Zotero field for that book.

Easy to install:
* Enter "..." into Zotero to use this style
* Remember to change your default style in Zotero preferences to this SBL-QTC style
* Remember to change your default style in the Word plugin to this SBL-QTC style
